[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tars/tars-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tars/tars-cli) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/tars/tars-cli.svg)](https://david-dm.org/tars/tars-cli)

!! This is a beta-release !!

There is no any docs, but you can run the command 'tars -h', to see all avalible commands.

If you would like to test tars-cli, you have to follow next steps:

1) Install tars-cli globally: 'npm install -g tars-cli'.
2) Create folder for project and go there.
3) Run the command 'tars init -s https://github.com/tars/tars/archive/version-1.3.0.zip'. This command will init tars in current directory.
4) Try to execute some tars-commands, like tars dev or tars build with different flags.
5) I would like to recieve all kind of feedbacks to tars.builder@gmail.com

Thank you.
